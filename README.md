**Safe Muster â€“ Human Stampede Early Warning System**
Safe Muster is an AI-powered system designed to prevent stampede disasters in high-density public gatherings like religious festivals, concerts, or political rallies. By using CCTV footage or webcam input, it detects crowd density, identifies fall patterns, and predicts potential stampede risk using deep learning techniques like YOLOv8, OpenPose, Optical Flow, and ConvLSTM.

**Features**
Real-time person detection using YOLOv8
Density heatmap generation
Fall and abnormal pose detection using OpenPose
Motion analysis via optical flow
ConvLSTM-based risk score prediction
Phone call alert to nearest police station when high risk is detected
Frontend built with Flask, HTML, and CSS
Prototype demo with webcam or video upload
